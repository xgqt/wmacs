# Wmacs


# About

This is a rewrite of my Emacs config that I initially did on 24.08.2020 on a Windows VM.


# Use

Clone this repo into ~/.emacs.d

`git clone --verbose https://gitlab.com/xgqt/wmacs ~/.emacs.d`

or

## Linux

run with `emacs -q --load init.el`

or

install with `bash install.sh`

## Windows

run with `C:\Emacs\bin\emacs.exe -q --load C:\Emacs\wmacs\init.el `
(assuming those are the correct paths to emacs and wmacs init)

or

copy to `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d`
